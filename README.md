Hey, welcome to my GitHub page. In this repository I am hosting my Data Science Portfolio. 

The portfolio is visualized in the form of a Gitbook. The easiest way to view my book is via this site: https://jarikoot.github.io/

There are some problems with this site (plots do not work and the index keeps changing) so the best way to see my book is to copy my repository into Rstudio and knit the index.Rmd file
