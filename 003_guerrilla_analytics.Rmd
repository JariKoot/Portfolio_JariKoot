================================================================================

>__About the exercise__

<br> 
During this exercise I learned about the Guerrilla Analytics Principles. I also added a proper folder structure to all my projects.

>__A__

- _Look at your RStudio project that you created for the DAUR-II final assignment_
- _Rearrange your project according the Guerilla principles explained above_
- _Add README files to the datasets_
- _Use the {fs} package to share a screenshot of your folder tree in your portfolio, look [here](https://www.tidyverse.org/blog/2018/01/fs-1.0.0/) for more info on how to use the {fs} package._

```{r folder structure, warning=FALSE}
library(fs)
dir_tree(path = ".")
```
