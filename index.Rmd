Hey there! I am Jari, a 21 year old Life Science student. With a passion for programming and biology. This is my bookdown portfolio and it is written in Rmarkdown. You can read this book by clicking on the Knit button or visit my website via __[this link](https://jarikoot.github.io/index.html)__

In this portfolio I will show you the skills I have learned during my DataScience for Biology minor. If you want to see all the files I created for this book than I recommend to visit __[my portfolio gihub page](https://github.com/JariKoot/Portfolio_JariKoot)__.
